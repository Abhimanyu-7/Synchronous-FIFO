## Overview

### What is it?
  A Synchronous FIFO is a type of a `data buffer` used to store data temporarily while it is moving from one place to another.

  It is  designed to act as a high-speed data buffer in digital systems operating under a **single clock domain**.

  A FIFO is essential in scenarios where **data transfer speed exceeds data processing speed**, preventing data loss and enabling smooth decoupling between different subsystems. The Synchronous FIFO ensures **`data integrity` , `order preservation`**  , and efficient **`flow control`** using handshaking mechanisms.

>[!NOTE]
> It is commonly used in digital systems to buffer data between two subsystems that are operating under the `same clock domain` but have `different data processing` speeds. 

## Motivation

In modern high-speed digital systems like SoCs, CPUs, DSPs, and DMA controllers, processing units may not always keep up with the rate at which data is being received from external interfaces or sensors. A FIFO provides **temporal storage**, enabling the receiver to process data at its own pace without data overrun or underrun.

> A Synchronous FIFO becomes critical when **both read and write operations occur at high speeds but are governed by the same system clock.**

## Architecture

The FIFO operates using:

- **Single clock domain** (same clock for read and write operations)
- **Dual-port memory array** for simultaneous read/write
- **Read and Write Pointers** for tracking positions
- **Full and Empty Flags** for flow control
- **Parameterizable Depth and Data Width**

## FIFO Operation States

| State      | Description                                         |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Reset**  | Initializes pointers, flags                         |
| **Idle**   | Waiting for write or read enable                    |
| **Write**  | Data is pushed into FIFO if not full                |
| **Read**   | Data is popped from FIFO if not empty               |
| **Full**   | Write is blocked until a read operation occurs      |
| **Empty**  | Read is blocked until data is available             |

| Parameter       | Description                   | Example     |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-------------|
| `DATA_WIDTH`   | Width of each data word        | `8`, `16`   |
